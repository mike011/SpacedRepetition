# SpacedRepetition
Implementing the concept of Spaced Repetition. Provides storage and incrementing for correct and incorrect answers.

Future Improvements

- Having more granularity for correct answers, something in minutes maybe?
- When you get a question wrong don't reset to the beginning. This one sounds tricky because how well do they know the question?
- Easily being able to show a stats screen
- Being able to answer with different times (eg; hard +1 day, medium +3 days, easy +6 days)
